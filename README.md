# RF Windmills

A mod for Minecraft that adds Redstone Flux generating windmills inspired by IC2's equivalent.
 
Compatible with Minecraft version 1.7.10. Uses Thermal Expansion's materials for its recipes if installed, otherwise will fall back to (less interesting) vanilla versions. See NEI for specifics.
